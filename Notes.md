We just writin in this bitch
Anyways I should take notes lol

ELEMENTS!!! RAHHHHHHHH
Elements in HTML look like: 
<tagname> placeholder text </tagname>

some examples are:
<!-- 
<html></html> 
<p></p> 
<body></body> 
<h1></h1> 
-->

eh you get it

Empty HTML ELEMENTS RAAAHAHHHHH
all i got for this part is that they dont need an ending tag <!-- </> this thing -->
EXAMPLE!!!!!
<!-- 
<br> this is a line break
<hr> this is a horizontal line
-->
